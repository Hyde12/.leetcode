# Testcase Example:  '[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]'
#
# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
# of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array
# [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section)
# are being trapped.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == height.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
# 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        l_max = []
        r_max = []
        
# @lc code=end

solution = Solution()
print(solution.trap([0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]))
